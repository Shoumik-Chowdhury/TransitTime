# LHL Node Skeleton

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information

- username: `labber`
- password: `labber`
- database: `transit_app`

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Start prisma: `npx prisma generate`

5. Run the server: `npm run local`

- Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
